      <h4>Discover more about Oceania Coral Reef with our data analysis of bleaching trends</h4>

        Our analysis is partitioned into five parts â€”
        Background, Environmental Drivers, Exploratory Data Analysis, Bleaching Trends, 
        and Predictive modeling.Although coral reefs only make up a small percentage of 
        the ocean population, they provide numerous benefits to the ecosystem and biodiverse 
        organisms. While coral reefs contain and provide shelter to over 800 different aquatic 
        species, the structure of coral reefs protects coastal communities.
